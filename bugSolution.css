The solution is to ensure the more specific style (`#myElement.myElement`) comes after the less specific styles. This means adjusting the order of the styles in your stylesheet.   In this specific case, moving the `#myElement.myElement` selector *above* `.myElement` in the stylesheet will resolve the issue.

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

#myElement.myElement {
  color: green; /* This style now correctly overrides */
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}
```

Alternatively, using the `!important` flag (though generally discouraged for maintainability) can ensure overriding: 

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myElement {
  color: green !important; /*Forces override*/
}
```
However, the order-based solution is generally preferred for better maintainability and readability.
