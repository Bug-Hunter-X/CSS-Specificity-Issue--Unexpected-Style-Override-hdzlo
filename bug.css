The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue where specificity conflicts cause unexpected styling behavior.  The `id` selector has higher specificity than the class selector, but the more general class selector applied later in the stylesheet overrides the ID selector's styling unexpectedly.

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myElement {
  color: green; /* This style should override, but might not due to unexpected CSS behavior */
}
```

The element with both the ID `myElement` and the class `myElement` may unexpectedly render with red text (from `.myElement`), not green (from `#myElement.myElement`).  This can happen if the browser encounters the `.myElement` rule *after* the `#myElement.myElement` rule, even if both are within the same stylesheet.  Some browsers might handle this differently due to how they parse and interpret cascaded stylesheets, causing inconsistencies.

This violates the expected specificity rules where an id selector (`#myElement`) would always override a class selector (`.myElement`).
